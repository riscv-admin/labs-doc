Hosting a Continuous Integration (CI) Project at a Lab
======================================================

Hosting a continuous integration project at a lab means providing RISC-V hardware or emulated compute instances as CI runners/agents for public use. CI compute instances can be integrated with version control systems such as GitHub, GitLab, etc. and can automate the build process of the source code for developers.

Following version control systems currently support RISC-V CI:

#. Jenkins
#. GitLab
