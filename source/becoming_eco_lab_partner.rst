Becoming an RISC-V Ecosystem Labs Partner
==========================================

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Overview
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A broad and robust software ecosystem is key to the success of RISC-V.
The RISC-V Ecosystem Labs program
brings together member companies from across the ecosystem to give developers the
resources they need to build and test their software, from porting of existing
projects to development of new components that will power the next wave of computing
innovation.

RISC-V Ecosystem Lab Partners provide one or more of the following:

- Continuous Integration (CI) testing of open source software projects
- CI testing resources for use by open source communities to use on their projects
- “Sandbox” instances of RISC-V physical and virtual hardware for open source communities and projects

For more information about the RISC-V Ecosystem Labs program, please see the
`RISC-V Ecosystem Labs page <https://riscv.org/risc-v-labs/>`_ on the RISC-V website.

The Lab Partner community meets every 2 weeks.  Agendas are published to the mailing list 
a day or two in advance of the meetings.  Meeting minutes are collected in the
`Labs Group Minutes <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HybKCHVE3KahfEiORgNRcmzVCqqFYVYVOLxjsKMz8gI/>`_
document in Google Drive.  All RISC-V members have comment access to the document.  Post a comment
against the document to request Edit access.

The meetings serve as a time for certified Ecosystem Lab members and newer members to exchange status,
work toward additional member certification, share status of existing labs, and collaborate to solve
common problems.
